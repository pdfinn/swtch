This directory holds the text form of the precomputed tables.

To interpret them you need to be able to find the canonical
(minimum) truth table value for a given Boolean function.
Then look up that function in the list.  The line will say something
like:

0x0000000f = 0x0f0f0f0f & 0x000000ff (size 2)

That means that one optimal way to compute the function with
canonical truth table 0x0000000f is to compute 0x0f0f0f0f and
0x000000ff optimally and then AND them together.  The resulting
Boolean expression will have size (number of operators) 2.

The operands on the right side of the equals sign are not necessarily
canonical.  You have to canonicalize on the way down during the 
recursion and then apply the reverse transformation on the way back
up to get the answer for the original formula.  See the code in app/web/
for an example.
